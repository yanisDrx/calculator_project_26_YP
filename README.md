**_validate_operands(a : object, b : object) -> None**
    verifying a and b parameters : a and b must be integers and not None ; for divide(), b must be other than 0 ; f

**sum(a : int, b : int) -> int**
    adding two ints.
    *returns int*

**substract(a : int, b : int) -> int**
    substracting two ints.
    *returns int*

**multiply(a : int, b : int) -> int**
    multiplying two ints.
    *returns int*

**divide(a : int, b : int) -> int**
    dividing two ints.
    *returns int*

## Tests
The test_simple_calculator allows you to see how the methods work and how to implement them into your work.
